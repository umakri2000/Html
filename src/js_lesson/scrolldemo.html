        Storing of junk files generates expenses. According to Sirius Decisions studies, a single junk (useless) record in a database might cost a company up to USD 100 per year. Lane Four explains that this loss stems from wasted work time and potential customer losses. Even the most prominent company can lose millions of dollars each year if they do not get rid of their useless files. Outdated files can also be misleading. Using them for essential business decision-making may lead to a financial catastrophe. It is especially dangerous for teams and companies that use classic Project Management methodologies. A single decision based on a lousy batch of data at an early stage of the development cycle can mount up with each consecutive step, accumulating into a botched product or a poorly designed feature.   
        
        On top of that, hoarding junk data can lead to legal problems, especially for companies that operate and gather information in EU countries. GDPR obliges them to collect only the necessary, minimum amount of data from their clients and users. Furthermore, these data must be easily accessible if they need to be deleted or edited and protected from a potential cyber-attack or a security breach. 
        
        Project management can be described as a process of data management and effective communication. Every piece of useless file can harm these elements. Project managers work daily on tasks and assignments with specific parameters, like name, estimated effort, start, end date, or supervisor’s name. Also, data relations are essential, and BigPicture can visualize dependencies in work breakdown structure, which relies on many connections. 
        
        If only one of the tasks’ parameters is incorrect, they can become junk data. In such a case, when the manager doesn’t know that or won’t spot the wrong set of information at the right time, he can jeopardize the entire undertaking. It begs the question: how can PPM software effectively help with junk data? BigPicture allows users to manage data in a few different ways. 
        
        How BigPicture helps to solve the problem of junk data 
        First of all, BigPicture is hosted on Jira and Jira can be configured and used as a Single Source of Truth. This method structures data, information, and its elements in one place. Single Source of Truth provides relevant, accurate, and referable data. If employees use Jira as a project management tool exclusively, it most likely becomes their source of truth. The matter gets complicated when the number of tools in use is increasing. That’s why BigPicture 8 introduced Boxes – universal, multifunctional, deeply customizable management spaces for tasks, deliverables, resources, risks, and… other Boxes. With Boxes, users can organize all projects, programs, products, teams, or entire portfolios into various collections and track them scientifically. The system integrates with Jira and Trello. Moreover, each stakeholder, on the other hand, acts within their own Box. Thus, rather than getting distracted, the individual project manager is busy observing the initiatives related to their organizational role only.
