            Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (audio speaker iconlisten); 
            pronounced [sət͡ʃin t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.
            [4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and as of 2021 the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[5] He was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.
            [6][7] He is affectionately known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster"</div>

                Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen,
                 and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[10] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11]
                 He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.></div>

                    Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[25]
                     a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[40] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[41] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[42] 
                     He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, 
                    during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[40]</p></div></hr/>
